# My Awesome Project

Welcome to my mock-up version of the Huffington Post newspaper website. This project was created using HTML5 & CSS3. During this project, I put my CSS skills to the test and mastered CSS layout.

Link to project: https://huffington.netlify.app

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I dove deep into my understanding of CSS layouts and used floats to design the finished product.

## Lessons Learned:
During the creation of this site, I learned the use of clearfix. Learning that parent elements that contain content collapse when the parent is not given a height really boosted my understanding of layout.

### Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
